# Company Formation Form Implementation Plan

## Overview
We are building a **simple, elegant** Company Formation form that feels effortless to complete. The system prioritizes **optimal UX** over technical complexity, with smart defaults, progressive disclosure, and minimal cognitive load for users.

**Core UX Principles:**
- **One thing at a time** - Single focus per step
- **Smart defaults** - Pre-fill what we can, suggest what makes sense  
- **Progressive disclosure** - Show only what's needed when it's needed
- **Instant feedback** - Real-time validation without being annoying
- **Recovery-friendly** - Auto-save everything, never lose progress

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **YAML Configuration System** - Each freezone has its own YAML file defining requirements, components, and business rules
2. **Component Library** - Reusable form components that can be configured via YAML
3. **Multi-Step Form Flow** - Progressive form with validation and state management
4. **File Upload System** - Handles document uploads (passports, certificates, etc.)
5. **Business Activities Integration** - Uses existing `business_activities` table
6. **State Management** - Tracks application progress and validation states

### Integration Strategy
- **Extend Existing**: Build on proven YAML parser and workflow system
- **Component Extraction**: Break down 564-line monolithic form into reusable components
- **Gradual Migration**: Feature flags allow safe A/B testing
- **Preserve Compatibility**: Existing routes and APIs continue working

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Simplified)

### 1.1 Essential Database Schema

- Minimal audit trail (who, when, what changed)

### 1.2 Smart Form Engine
- YAML-driven form configuration (simple, readable)
- Component-based architecture with 5 core components max
- Auto-save every field change (transparent to user)
- Smart validation (validate on blur, not on type)

### 1.3 UX-First Components
- **Single-purpose components** - each does one thing well
- **Contextual help** - show help when needed, hide when not
- **Visual hierarchy** - clear information architecture
- **Mobile-first** - works perfectly on phone

## Phase 2: 5 Essential Components (UX Optimized)
