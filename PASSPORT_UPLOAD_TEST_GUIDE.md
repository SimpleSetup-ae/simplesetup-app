# 🧪 Passport Upload Testing Guide

## ✅ **Fixed Issues & Enhanced Features**

### Issues Resolved:
1. **❌ "Upload failed: Unprocessable Content"** → ✅ **FIXED**
   - Removed `temperature: 0.1` parameter (GPT-5 doesn't support it)
   - Fixed Gemini fallback null pointer errors

2. **❌ "Extraction failed"** → ✅ **FIXED** 
   - Fixed API parameter compatibility with GPT-5
   - Added proper error handling for all failure cases

3. **❌ Skeleton loaders not showing** → ✅ **FIXED**
   - Connected `onProcessingStart/End` callbacks to `extracting` state
   - Skeleton loaders now trigger when file is selected

4. **❌ Grey overlay not appearing** → ✅ **FIXED**
   - Overlay now appears immediately when processing starts
   - Shows "Processing..." message with spinner

## 🎯 **How to Test the Enhanced Features**

### Step 1: Navigate to Members Page
```
http://localhost:3000/application/{id}/members
```

### Step 2: Upload Passport Image
1. Click "Choose Passport Image" 
2. Select any image file (JPG, PNG)

### Step 3: Watch the Enhanced Loading Experience

**🔄 Expected Behavior:**

**Phase 1: Upload (0-35%)**
- Progress bar: "Uploading... 15%"
- Form fields: **Transform to animated skeleton loaders**
- Overlay: **Grey transparent layer appears** with "Processing..."

**Phase 2: AI Processing (35-100%)**  
- Progress bar: "Processing... 75%"
- Form fields: **Continue showing skeleton loaders**
- Overlay: **Remains active** with spinner

**Phase 3: Completion (100%)**
- Progress bar: "Extraction completed (94% confidence)"
- Form fields: **Skeleton loaders disappear**
- Overlay: **Disappears**
- Data: **Auto-fills** First Name, Last Name, etc.

## 🎨 **Visual Enhancements**

### Skeleton Loaders:
- **Animated pulse effect** in grey
- **Exact same size** as original input fields
- **All form fields**: First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Gender, DOB, Nationality, Passport Number

### Grey Overlay:
- **Semi-transparent background**: `bg-gray-500/20`
- **Subtle blur effect**: `backdrop-blur-[1px]`
- **Floating message card**: White background with shadow
- **Centered spinner**: "Processing..." with loading icon

### Progress Bar:
- **Clean design**: No emojis or waypoints
- **Simple text**: "Uploading..." → "Processing..."
- **Realistic timing**: Upload to 35%, then AI processing to 100%

## 🚀 **Backend GPT-5 Configuration**

### Verified Working:
```ruby
# backend/app/services/passport_extraction_service.rb
request.body = {
  model: 'gpt-5',  # ✅ Strictly GPT-5 as requested
  messages: [...],
  reasoning_effort: 'minimal',
  max_completion_tokens: 1000
  # No temperature parameter (GPT-5 doesn't support custom values)
}
```

### Expected Log Output:
```
[PassportExtraction] Using OpenAI GPT-5 for extraction
[PassportExtraction] OpenAI response code: 200
[PassportExtraction] Successful response from OpenAI
[PassportExtraction] OpenAI result: Success
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### If skeleton loaders don't appear:
1. Check browser console for React errors
2. Verify `extracting` state is being set
3. Check that `onProcessingStart` callback is being called

### If extraction still fails:
1. Check Rails logs for specific error messages
2. Verify OpenAI API key is configured
3. Ensure image file is valid format

### If overlay doesn't show:
1. Verify `extracting === person.id` condition
2. Check CSS classes are properly applied
3. Ensure relative positioning on parent container

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

The passport upload feature should now:
- ✅ Show skeleton loaders immediately when file is selected
- ✅ Display grey overlay with "Processing..." message
- ✅ Progress from 0% → 35% (upload) → 100% (AI processing)
- ✅ Use GPT-5 model for extraction without errors
- ✅ Auto-fill form fields when extraction completes
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully with proper cleanup

**Test Result Expected**: Professional loading experience with clear visual feedback throughout the entire passport processing workflow! 🎉
