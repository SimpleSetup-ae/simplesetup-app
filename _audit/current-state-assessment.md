## Current State Audit - Passport Upload Feature

### Frontend Status ✅
- **Next.js app**: Runs correctly on port 3000
- **PassportUpload component**: Well-structured, feature-complete
- **UI/UX**: shadcn/ui components working, clean interface
- **File handling**: Drag/drop, validation, base64 conversion works
- **Route**: `/workflow/passport-demo` serves correctly

### Backend Status ❌ BROKEN
**Critical Issues:**
1. **Bundle/Gemfile path issues**: `Could not locate Gemfile or .bundle/ directory`
2. **Rails command broken**: Tries to run `rails new` instead of server
3. **Binstubs missing**: `./bin/rails` doesn't exist
4. **Environment variables**: Not properly loaded
5. **Database migrations**: RLS migrations skipped (local dev issue)

### API Dependencies ⚠️ MISSING
- **OpenAI API key**: Required for passport OCR extraction
- **Google Gemini key**: Alternative OCR service
- **Clerk auth**: Not configured for local dev

### What Works vs. What's Broken

#### ✅ Working:
- Frontend UI and file selection
- Database schema (core tables migrated)
- PostgreSQL connection
- Redis running
- File validation and thumbnails

#### ❌ Broken:
- Backend Rails server won't start
- API endpoints unreachable
- No passport processing (missing AI keys)
- Bundle/gem environment corrupted

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Bundle corruption**: The `backend/` directory has bundle issues
2. **Missing binstubs**: Rails executables not generated
3. **Incomplete setup**: Backend never fully initialized
4. **Skipped migrations**: RLS policies disabled, may have side effects

### Recommendation: CLEAN RESTART

**Reasons:**
1. Backend is fundamentally broken (bundle, binstubs, Rails setup)
2. Faster to rebuild clean than debug corrupted state
3. Can preserve working frontend components
4. Clean slate ensures proper Rails 7 setup

### Clean Restart Plan
1. **Keep**: Frontend code (working), database schema, audit docs
2. **Rebuild**: Backend Rails app from scratch with proper setup
3. **Fix**: Environment variables, API keys, proper bundle setup
4. **Test**: Create automated tests to prevent regression

### Estimated Time
- **Fix current**: 2-3 hours debugging bundle/Rails issues
- **Clean restart**: 1 hour to rebuild backend properly

**Recommendation: Clean restart is more reliable and faster.**
