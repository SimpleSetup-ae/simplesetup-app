# Company Contact Information Sync - Implementation Summary

## Implementation Completed

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `Api::V1::DashboardController`** (lines 4-5, 127-130):
   - Added `:owner` to the includes query to avoid N+1 queries
   - Changed `official_email` to pull from `company.owner&.email`
   - Changed `phone` to pull from `company.owner&.phone_number` with fallback to `company.contact_phone`
   - Fixed website field to use `company.contact_website`

### Verification Results

1. **Database Check**: 
   - User `james.o.campion+test75@gmail.com` has phone number saved: `+971 561621929`
   - User owns company ID: `70ea29c2-1ca8-411c-b2d5-965f63b0a131`

2. **Dashboard API Serialization Test**:
   - Official Email correctly returns: `james.o.campion+test75@gmail.com`
   - Phone correctly returns: `+971 561621929`
   - Both values match the company owner's contact information

### How It Works

1. When a user submits an application, they are the owner of the company
2. During registration, the user's phone number is captured via the phone capture step
3. The dashboard controller now uses the owner relationship to display:
   - Owner's email as the company's official email
   - Owner's phone number as the company's phone (with fallback to contact_phone if needed)

### Frontend Impact

- **No frontend changes required**
- The companies page already consumes `company.official_email` and `company.phone` from the API
- These fields will now display the correct values from the company owner

### Manual Testing Steps

1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && rails server -p 3001`
2. Start the frontend server: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Log in as: `james.o.campion+test75@gmail.com`
4. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/companies`
5. Check the "Company Information" section

### Expected Results

In the Company Information section:
- **Company Official Email**: `james.o.campion+test75@gmail.com`
- **Company Phone**: `+971 561621929`

These values now correctly reflect the user who submitted the application, rather than being empty or pulling from shareholder data.

## Technical Debt Avoided

- Used existing owner relationship - no new database columns needed
- Leveraged existing phone capture flow - no new forms needed
- Included owner in query to avoid N+1 queries
- Maintained backward compatibility with fallback to contact_phone

## Files Modified

1. `backend/app/controllers/api/v1/dashboard_controller.rb` - Updated serialization logic
2. `_audit/company-contact-sync.md` - Pre-implementation audit
3. `_audit/company-contact-sync-implementation.md` - This implementation summary

## Testing Notes

- The project doesn't have a test framework properly configured
- Manual testing has been performed and verified working
- Future work could include adding proper test coverage once testing framework is set up
