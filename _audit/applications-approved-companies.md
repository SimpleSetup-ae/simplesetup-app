# Audit: Users Tab Implementation

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Existing Users Page ✅ ALREADY EXISTS
**File**: `frontend/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`
- Admin users page already exists at `/admin/users`
- Shows basic user information: name, email, role, status
- Has admin management functionality (create, toggle admin, lock/unlock)

### Backend API ✅ EXISTS BUT NEEDS ENHANCEMENT
**File**: `backend/app/controllers/api/v1/admin/users_controller.rb`
- Admin users controller exists with full CRUD operations
- Current serialization missing phone numbers and application status
- Need to add phone_number and application status to response

### User Creation Flow ✅ UNDERSTOOD
**Files**: 
- `backend/app/controllers/api/v1/inline_registrations_controller.rb`
- `frontend/src/components/forms/company-formation/steps/UserSignUpStep.tsx`

**Process**:
1. User starts anonymous application at `/application/new`
2. After initial form, user is prompted to create account
3. Email confirmation via OTP system
4. Phone number collection in `update_phone` endpoint
5. Application gets claimed by user (changes from anonymous_draft to user-owned)

### Database Schema ✅ COMPLETE
- `users.phone_number` field exists
- `users.phone_verified` field exists  
- Users linked to companies via `owner_id`
- Company status field available for application status

## Required Changes

### Backend Updates Needed
1. **Update `serialize_admin_user` method** to include:
   - `phoneNumber: user.phone_number`
   - `phoneVerified: user.phone_verified`
   - `applicationStatus: user.owned_companies.first&.status` (or latest application)

2. **Consider application status logic**:
   - Users can have multiple companies/applications
   - Need to determine which status to show (latest? primary?)
   - Handle users with no applications

### Frontend Updates Needed
1. **Update AdminUser interface** to include:
   - `phoneNumber?: string`
   - `phoneVerified?: boolean` 
   - `applicationStatus?: string`

2. **Update table columns** to show:
   - Phone number column
   - Application status column with proper badges

3. **Update filters** if needed for application status

## Implementation Plan
1. Update backend serialization to include phone and application status
2. Update frontend interface and table display
3. Add proper status badges and formatting
4. Test with existing users who have phone numbers and applications
