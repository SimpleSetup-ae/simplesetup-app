# Users Page - Comprehensive Fix for Client Access

## Problem Statement
When logged in as a client (james.o.campion+test77@gmail.com), the Users page was showing "Failed to fetch team members" error. The user should see themselves as the company owner in the team members list.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Controller Callback Errors
The `CompanyMembershipsController` had invalid callback references:
- `before_action :set_company, only: [:index, :create, :invite, :remove]` - but `remove` action didn't exist
- `before_action :set_membership, only: [:show, :update, :destroy, :accept, :reject]` - but `accept` and `reject` actions didn't exist

### 2. Missing Owner in Team Members
Company owners were not appearing in the team members list because:
- Owners have a direct relationship via `companies.owner_id`
- They might not have an explicit record in `company_memberships` table
- The controller was only fetching from `company_memberships`

### 3. Authentication Working Correctly
The authentication system using Devise sessions was working properly. The issue was purely in the controller logic.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Controller Callbacks
```ruby
# Fixed callbacks to only reference existing actions
before_action :set_company, only: [:index, :create, :invite]
before_action :set_membership, only: [:show, :update, :destroy]
```

### 2. Added Virtual Owner Membership
Modified the `index` action to include the owner as a virtual membership:

```ruby
def index
  # Build members array including the owner if they don't have a membership record
  members = []
  
  # Add the owner as a virtual membership if they exist and don't have a membership
  if @company.owner && !@memberships.exists?(user: @company.owner)
    owner_membership = serialize_owner_as_membership(@company)
    members << owner_membership if owner_membership
  end
  
  # Add all existing memberships
  members += @memberships.map { |membership| serialize_membership(membership) }
  
  # Return combined results
  render json: {
    success: true,
    data: {
      members: members,
      # ...
    }
  }
end
```

### 3. Created Owner Serialization Method
```ruby
def serialize_owner_as_membership(company)
  return nil unless company.owner
  
  {
    id: "owner-#{company.owner.id}",
    role: 'owner',
    accepted: true,
    accepted_at: company.created_at.iso8601,
    created_at: company.created_at.iso8601,
    user: {
      id: company.owner.id,
      email: company.owner.email,
      full_name: company.owner.full_name,
      # ... other user fields
    },
    company: {
      id: company.id,
      name: company.name
    }
  }
end
```

## Data Model Understanding
```
User (james.o.campion+test77@gmail.com)
  ↓ owner_id
Company (Draft Application)
  ↓ has_many
CompanyMemberships (empty for this company)
```

The user owns the company but doesn't have a membership record, which is a valid state in the system.

## Testing Results

### Manual API Testing
```bash
# Authentication works
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/sign_in
# Response: {"success": true, ...}

# Company memberships returns owner
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/company_memberships
# Response: {
#   "success": true,
#   "data": {
#     "members": [{
#       "id": "owner-3a392bce-0d75-467c-9ae4-bb59ba6a42b7",
#       "role": "owner",
#       "user": {
#         "email": "james.o.campion+test77@gmail.com",
#         ...
#       }
#     }],
#     "stats": {
#       "total_members": 1,
#       ...
#     }
#   }
# }

# Other endpoints also work
# Tax registrations: Returns empty data gracefully
# Visa applications: Returns empty data gracefully
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Isolation Maintained
- Users can only see team members for companies they have access to
- The `can_access_company?` method ensures proper authorization
- No cross-company data leakage

### Authorization Flow
1. User authenticates via Devise session
2. Controller checks `can_access_company?`
3. Only returns data for accessible companies

## Files Modified
1. `backend/app/controllers/api/v1/company_memberships_controller.rb`
   - Fixed callback declarations
   - Added virtual owner membership logic
   - Added `serialize_owner_as_membership` method

## Result
✅ Client users can now access the Users page without errors
✅ Company owners appear in the team members list with "owner" role
✅ No duplicate entries if owner also has a membership record
✅ All related endpoints (accounting, visas) also work correctly
✅ Authentication and authorization remain secure
✅ Data isolation is maintained

## Lessons Learned
1. **Always verify callback actions exist** - Rails 7.1 is stricter about missing callback actions
2. **Consider virtual relationships** - Not all relationships need database records
3. **Test with actual user scenarios** - Testing with real user data revealed the issue
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** - Solution works for both owners with and without membership records
